# Software Tools User Group software distribution

These are files from the [Software Tools User Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_tools_users_group) software for [Ratfor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor) originally distributed on 9-track tapes in the early 1980s. 

The directories basic and toys correspond to the two tapes. The first file, which I have renamed README.txt is the guide to the rest of the files. Some of those files are in Ratfor archive format, which should be trivial to write a script to extract from.

I have uploaded this to Github for historical interest for anybody who wishes to study the software.
